# Disney Rating Text Analysis
## By Kiana Gonzalez-Rodholm
### Project Summary
As a Cast Member who works for the Walt Disney Company and as a person who is a huge fan of Disney parks, I often have the conversation on which Disney Resort is better. After finding some Trip Advisor data on three different resorts, I wanted to discover what truly makes the resort most favorable and why. The data I have found has variables including a 1-5 ranking of satisfaction, review comments, and graphical information regarding the Guests to those who have visited either the California, Hong Kong, or Paris Disney Resorts. Through this analysis we solve the business problem: What can we do as a company to make a better Guest experience? 

### Methods  
This project used text reviews and ratings of various Disney parks around the world and used graph analysis to look at the rankings of each resort to see which one had a higher satisfaction rating. There was also feature extraction performed on the variables, and then text analysis was then used to find those with positive ratings based off their comments. The text classification model was used to classify each review as positive or negative overall to see which parks had better Guest satisfaction. Other visualizations and graphs were also create to alanyze the data such as histograms, bar charts, and scatterplots.

### Future Application  
Some additional opportunities to be explored here are to examine the negative reviews more carefully, using the lower ratings to see why a Guest had a negative experience and try to solve as a company what they can do to fix some of them. Becuase this analysis focuses on the more favorable reviews and positive aspects of the data, those results can also be used to further analyze what those were and make policy or business changes based off of the positive reviews.
