# Movie Ratings and Streaming EDA
## By Kiana Gonzalez-Rodholm
### Project Summary
I wanted to discover multiple elements of the film industry, in order to see what types of films are more successful, and in hopes to find that Disney is one of the higher ranked production companies. I used IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes ratings as a guideline to gauge what makes a movie a success. Streaming data was also analyzed to see what platforms tended to have higher rated movies as well as what genres each streaming service tended to favor. Using ggplot and other techniques in R, this project takes three different data sets with different movie ratings and performs EDA using visualizations and statistical analysis.

### Research Questions Answered
*	Does Disney hold a majority of highly rated movies?
*	How do Disney movies compare to other production companies as far as ratings and earnings?
*	Do different genres tend to better in ratings than others?
*	Does the director of the film tend to sway the data towards a good or bad rating?
*	Which streaming service offers the most popular movies?
*	Which streaming service offers the least popular movies?
*	Do IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes tend to rate movies about the same?
*	Do foreign films tend to have higher or lower ratings?

### Results/Future Application
Line charts, scatterplots, pie charts, histograms, and bar graphs were all greated to answer these research questions. It was discovered that the ratings were very wide spread, with little correlations between features. Although Disney movies did tend to rate higher overall, there were still differences between the platforms. Future application could be to explore more variables such as how much the budget was versus how much the movie earned to see if there was significant win or loss. We could also look at the language the film is spoken in to see if that has any affect on its viewership or success. There are so many things to consider and so many elements to look at with film.
