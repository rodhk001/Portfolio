# Movie Ratings and Streaming EDA
## By Kiana Gonzalez-Rodholm
### Project Summary
As someone who has always enjoyed film and going to the movies, I thought it would be interesting to analyze the film industry. I have a special connection to Disney films in particular, as I have been a Cast Member for over 10 years, and have always loved Disney movies. I am curious to see how Disney movies compare to other films in the industry as far as success and ratings. I not only want to look at the trend between ratings but between genres and even different directors to potentially predict what makes a “good” movie and whether or not Disney is a contributor to those movies.

### Research Questions
•	Does Disney hold a majority of highly rated movies?
•	How do Disney movies compare to other production companies as far as ratings and earnings?
•	Do different genres tend to better in ratings than others?
•	Does the director of the film tend to sway the data towards a good or bad rating?
•	Which streaming service offers the most popular movies?
•	Which streaming service offers the least popular movies?
•	Do IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes tend to rate movies about the same?
•	Do foreign films tend to have higher or lower ratings?
