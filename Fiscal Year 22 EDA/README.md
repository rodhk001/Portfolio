# Fiscal Year 22 Metrics Analysis
## By Kiana Gonzalez-Rodholm
### Project Summary
This project will focus on a real-life application of data science for my current job in efforts to report the work that has been done over the last fiscal year, describe how the work has changed, and what work is left to be done. A new digital platform was introduced in 2019, and so it is necessary to show the impacts of that work on the current fiscal year as well.
The main business problem is that we need to find a way to show executives that the work we have been doing over the past year is important, continues to grow, and that the need for permanent positions and temporary positions are still relevant. This analysis and presentation are necessary to maintain our current funding and be able to justify why we may need more funding in the future. Some research questions include: How does the new digital platform impact the work? How much of the original work is still being done? How efficient is this new platform? Does the efficiency mean less or more positions are needed to get the work done?

### Methods
The bulk of this work was done in Python to pull statistical analysis off the data, clean the data, and to make visualizations. I used the Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn packages for the data analysis and visualizations. Based off those findings, I then used the data to make more graphs in PowerPoint to get the colors and professional look needed to present to the executives. Since other graphing tools like Tableau were not available on my work computer, and the graphs/data are relatively simple, it was decided that the PowerPoint graphs would suffice.

### Findings/Opportunities
This project was a great test of my flexibility as a data scientist to change tactics and readjust my analysis based on what upper management was looking for. I had to address the fact that some things they were looking for were either not possible with the data that was currently available, or that the visualizations could not be created and be accurate. This project helped me to work with others and be able to adapt and fine tune my visualizations by keeping the analysis accurate.
