# Airline EDA with Visualizations
## By Kiana Gonzalez-Rodholm
### Project Summary
Although there is no direct code, this project goes through various visual mediums such as a Tableau dashboard, PowerPoint presentation, blog post, infographic, and an informative video. The data analysis is presented in various ways to show different visual analysis of data and different presentation platforms depending on the audience. AUdiences targeted throughout the various visualization techniques include a direct team, management, executives, blog readers, and the general public.

### Project Backstory
The basis for this project was the assumption that the media was stating that airplanes are no longer safe especially in relation to cars, and this project was used to show the inaccuracies of that statement. Through the role of a data analyst for an airline company, this is how I would combat that statement using various visualization techniques based off of real data.

### Future Application
One could further the audience reach by working with the marketing team to get adds out showing the importance of the message based off of the data and results collected here. Marketing could then use the information to release adds/inforgraphics on various platforms such as websites, social media, newpapers/articles, etc.
