# High School Performance EDA
## By Kiana Gonzalez-Rodholm
### Project Summary
This project studies the affects that alcohol consumption has on high school performance using Python and R. There was a wide amount of categorical data from two different sets of classes (Language and Math), and multiple visual and statistical analysis processes were performed on the data to see what else affects high school performance other than alcohol. A random forest regression and classifier model were created to generate information on what could predict future high school performance.

### Methods
Correlation charts, bar charts, and scatterplots were created in R to further viusalize the data. A random forest regression and classifier model were created using Python along with a feature importance data frame to show which of the features were more important in correlation to the overall grades. A presentaion was made in Powerpoint to explain and present these findings.


### Results
* Alcohol consumption didn’t have as high or an affect on grades as was expected.
* Other features such as past failures, absences, and health were influences in students’ grades.
* Features differ between each class, since there is a different dynamic between a math and language class. 
* If there was more data, perhaps we would get more generalized or even different results.
