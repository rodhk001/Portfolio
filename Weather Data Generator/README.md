# Weather Data Generator Application
## By Kiana Gonzalez-Rodholm
### Project Summary
This program is meant to open a weather webservice and will display weather results depending on the user input. The user is asked to input a city or zip code (in the United States) and the appropriate weather information will display. The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate basic coding skills in Python from start to finish with error detection if incorrect data is entered. This was also my first application created and can be used as an example of the growth shown over the course of a few years in my graduate program.

### Future Application
This application can be further used, once the data has been generated, to be extracted and placed into a data frame for analysis. One could then perform exploratory data analysis on the data and draw further conclusions. The user input feature could be extracted if not necessary to be used for data analysis.
