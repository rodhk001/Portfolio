# Covid Vaccine Analysis Project
## By Kiana Gonzalez-Rodholm
For this project I chose to work with a data set containing information on COVID vaccine distribution for various countries. 
My business question was: how does the United States compare to other countries as far as vaccine distribution? 
I also wanted to find out how the variables were related and find general information from the data by country. 

I found through my analysis that a lognormal model is a good fit for the distribution of this data. 
I also found that although slow to start, the US has exponentially grown in vaccine distribution compared to other countries. 
When comparing different variables together to find correlation, I discovered that total vaccinations and people fully vaccinated are positively correlated and statistically significant. 
This is to be expected because the higher number of people that are fully vaccinated means that more people had one or two shots, and therefore contribute to the total number of vaccinations.
