# About
A recent graduate of Bellevue University's Data Science Graduate progam, I am eager to show you what I have learned and what I am capable of. Here you will find a collection of some of my favorite data science projects.

# Projects
1. **Video Game EDA**  
- This project will focus on video game sales by performing an exploratory data analysis along with predictive modeling to gather information for future game designs. Questions answered in the analysis include What makes a great video game? What console is the higher selling console or platform? Which games had the highest sales? Can we predict what games might do well in the future? Did the 2020 pandemic affect sales positively or negatively?
2. **Breast Cancer Image Classification**  
- Image classifican project to build a model which can classify an image as benign, malignant, or normal.
3. **Fiscal Year Metrics Project**  
- Documentation metrics analysis for my company to gather information of all the work down for the fiscal year to present to executives. 
4. **Airline Safety EDA with Visualizations** 
- This project goes through various visual mediums such as a Tableau dashboard, PowerPoint presentation, blog post, infographic, and an informative video. The data analysis is presented in various ways to show different visual analysis of data and different presentation platforms depending on the audience. 
5. **COVID Vaccine Analysis**
- This project takes data from the status of people who were vaccinated, partially vaccinated, and not vaccinated for COVID 19 and provides visual and statistical analysis using R. The main business question was to see how the US compared to other countries when it came to vaccination numbers. Some analysis techniques used were CDF and PMF graphs, histograms, pareto and lognormal distribution curves, scatterplots, and correlation charts. There was also a regression model built to see if predicting where the vaccination rates will go was also conducted and presented.
6. **Disney Rating and Text Analysis**
- This project used Trip Advisor text reviews and ratings of various Disney parks around the world and used graph analysis to look at the rankings of each resort to see which one had a higher satisfaction rating. There was also feature extraction performed on the variables, and then text analysis was then used to find those with positive ratings based off their comments. The text classification model was used to classify each review as positive or negative overall to see which parks had better Guest satisfaction. 
7. **High School Performance EDA**
- This project studies the affects that alcohol consumption has on high school performance using Python and R. There was a wide amount of categorical data from two different sets of classes, and multiple visual and statistical analysis processes were performed on the data to see what else affects high school performance other than alcohol. A random forest regression and classifier model were created to generate information on what could predict future high school performance.
11. **Movie Ratings and Streaming EDA**
- Using ggplot and other techniques in R, this project takes three different data sets with different movie ratings and performs EDA using visualizations and statistical analysis. This project was used to discover what types of films are more successful, which directors have the highest rated movie, and what production companies make the best movies. IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes ratings were as a guideline to gauge what makes a movie a success. Streaming data was also analyzed to see what platforms tended to have higher rated movies as well as what genres each streaming service tended to favor.
12. **Weather Data Extraction and Cleaning**
- This project uses Australian weather data to demonstrate various data extracting and cleaning techniques. Weather data was pulled from a local csv file, web data was pulled off a Wikipedia page, and a website using an API call was also used to extract weather data. The various forms of data were brought into Python and cleaned for data analysis using various cleaning methods. All the data was then merged into one data set using SQLLite.
13. **Weather Data Generator**
- This project is a simple but effective application that demonstrates Python coding expertise by pulling weather information off of the internet and displaying the results. A user could input any location using either a zip code or city and would generate various weather data using an API key. An error message will also display if an incorrect or invalid location is entered.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
