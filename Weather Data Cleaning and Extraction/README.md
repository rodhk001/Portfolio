# Weather Data Cleaning and Extraction Project
## By Kiana Gonzalez-Rodholm
### Project Summary
This project uses Australian weather data to demonstrate various data extracting and cleaning techniques. Weather data was pulled from a local csv file, web data was pulled off a Wikipedia page, and a website using an API call was also used to extract weather data. The various forms of data were brought into Python and cleaned for data analysis using various cleaning methods. All the data was then merged into one data set using SQLLite.
### Findings
This project was able to showcase many data cleaning and extraction skills. API call was used to extract weather data from a site, urllib and Beautiful Soup was used to pull table data off of a website, and pandas was used along with other cleaning methods in Pandas. Some examples include changing columns, removing unnnecessary data, finding outliers and missing data, fixing spelling and formatting errors, etc. SQLLite was also used to pull all of the common data into a database, and then push out another data frame to be used as a final analysis with basic visualizations and summary statistics performed on the final data set.
### Future Application
By the end of cleaning and merging all the data sets, only 10 locations were used with merged weather data. If more common information was found accross the data sets (more locations were called by the API) this analysis would be more beneficial. The overall analysis can be furthered in this regard, even though the main purpose of the project was to show extraction and cleaning skills.
