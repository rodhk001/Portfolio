# Weather Data Cleaning and Extraction Project
## By Kiana Gonzalez-Rodholm
### Project Summary
This project uses Australian weather data to demonstrate various data extracting and cleaning techniques. Weather data was pulled from a local csv file, web data was pulled off a Wikipedia page, and a website using an API call was also used to extract weather data. The various forms of data were brought into Python and cleaned for data analysis using various cleaning methods. All the data was then merged into one data set using SQLLite.
